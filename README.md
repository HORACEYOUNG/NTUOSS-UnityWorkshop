### Prerequisites

1. Unity Game Engine Software

   [You can download Unity Personal Version by clicking this link.](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal)

   Unity Personal Version is free as long as the organization of the user does not make more than $100k in annual gross revenues.

   ###### **Warning: We highly recommend you to download unity prior to coming to this workshop as it may take 30 - 60 minutes to complete the download.**

2. Visual Studio 2017 (or any other IDE you like for C# language)

   Visual Studio 2017 is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft.

   As Unity Engine is based on C# language, Visual Studio 2017 serves this cause.

   We would recommend using Visual Studio 2017 for consistency because the speaker would use it and to prevent possible misunderstandings.

3. Basic Object-Oriented Programming Knowledge (optional)
